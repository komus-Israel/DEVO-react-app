Devo is a dapp built on the ethereum blockchain. The smart contract can be found [here](https://github.com/komus-Israel/DEVO-smart-contract) 

The purpose of this client application is to visualize how an application can interact with a smart contract and how DEVO smart contract can be used to solve voting issues.

This application isn't 100% secured as an identity can register with various addresses however the security of a decentralized voting system can improved with the advent of AI. Facial recognition model can be integrated with biometrics to enhance the security of the system.
